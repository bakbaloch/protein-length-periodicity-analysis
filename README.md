Protein Length Periodicity Analysis
This repository contains my analysis of periodic patterns in eukaryotic protein lengths. The work includes data preparation, exploratory checks, and a reanalysis of the signal reported in earlier studies.
Project Structure
data/       – raw and preprocessed protein length datasets  
scripts/    – Python scripts and notebooks used for the analysis  
results/    – final figures generated during the analysis  

Overview
The goal of this project was to check whether protein length distributions across several eukaryotic species show any recurring periodic signals. I used Python to explore the datasets, compute frequency patterns, and recreate the figures used in the analysis.
All code used to run the analysis is in the scripts/ folder, and the datasets are in the data/ folder. Figures produced by the scripts are stored in results/.
Files
diverse_eukaryotic_enzymes.csv – raw dataset


diverse_eukaryotic_enzymes_preprocessed.csv – cleaned dataset


Python scripts (protein-analysis-python.py, sad-python-implementation.py)


Generated figures (Figure_1, Figure_2, etc.)


Notes
This repository is meant to serve as a record of the work I did for this analysis and to keep the code and results organized.
